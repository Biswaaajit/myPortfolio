        During my Web Design & Development course, I learned HTML, CSS, jQuery,
        Bootstrap, SQL, and basic JavaScript to build responsive and interactive
        websites. I completed several basic projects and a major project,
        applying these skills to create functional web applications. This
        experience enhanced my ability to design and develop user-friendly
        websites efficiently.

        management to build modern web applications. I gained hands-on

        and server-side rendering. Through 10+ real-world projects, I mastered
        custom hooks, reusable components, Tailwind CSS, and Styled Components.
        I also explored Reactâ€™s internals, the Virtual DOM, React Server
        Components, and Server Actions
